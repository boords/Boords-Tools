## Getting Started

### Step 1) Download the Boords Tools After Effects Script 

To get started, download the Boords Tools After Effects Script from GitHub. It comes as a ZIP file, which contains the `BoordsTools` directory and the `BoordsTools.jsx` script file. 

###### [Download the After Effects Script](https://github.com/boords/Boords-Tools/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

### Step 2) Install the Script 

Unzip the Boords Tools Script ZIP file, and move the contents of the directory into your After Effects `ScriptUI Panels` directory:

It's important to move both the `BoordsTools` directory __AND__ the `BoordsTools.jsx` file into `ScriptUI Panels`. It won't work if you skip this.

_Moving the directory and script file_

On a Mac, `ScriptUI Panels` will be located within the After Effects application directory: 

`/Applications/Adobe After Effects CC 2017/Scripts/ScriptUI Panel`

The exact location will vary with your After Effects version, so you may need to do a little exploration in Finder. 

### Step 3) Restart After Effects

Once you've added `BoordsTools` and `BoordsTools.jsx` to `ScriptUI Panels`, restart After Effects. 

Congratulations! You're ready to go.

## Using the Boords Tools Script

The Boords Tools Script works by turning a folder you'll export from Boords into an After Effects composition. Let's go through the process step-by-step. 


### Step 1) Export your storyboard from Boords 

Within the storyboard you'd like to convert to an animatic, select 'After Effects > Download Images' from the export menu:

This will download your storyboard as a ZIP file containing everything you need to create your animatic. Go ahead and unzip it. 


### Step 2) Open the Boords Tools panel 

With the 'Window' menu open, select the `BoordsTools.jsx` plugin. This will open the Boords Tools panel.

### Step 3) Create your animatic

Open the script, then select your Boords folder. You'll be prompted to add a sound file. Just click cancel if you don't have one.

### Step 4) Add sound & notes (optional)

You can add a reference later with voiceover, label, and action text. The script will ask you if you'd like to do this:

This can take a while, particularly for longer storyboards. 1 minute or longer is not uncommon. Please be patient!
